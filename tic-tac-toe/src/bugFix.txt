 

 before gamestart lock the grids


Start game logic:

in startgame the player1ready is false so it emits that palyer1 is ready on startgame button press and the server broadcasts to the other player
so it can display that "Other player is ready, press start!" and changes the palyer1Ready to true.
Now in the strtGame we go to second condition and display "your turn" and emit to the server which brodacasts to other client so it 
can display "his turn" and change player2ready to true so that when we reset grid it resets both sides.
